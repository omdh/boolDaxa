 /
 / Use BoolSet to create a set of boolean values to represent some abstraction. This abstract data type provides specificity by being adopted by a concrete type.
 /
 / BoolSets use a bitarray as an underlying data structure. An 'on' bit represents a truth value, and a 'off' bit represents a false value. Bitarrays are used to better performance by requiring less processor calls for SetAlgebra methods. 
 / 
 / RawRepresentable was not used as the initializer (like OptionSet), because you are guaranteed an initialization upon providing a rawValue, unlike the optional initializer for RawRepresentable.
